abstract="Stream reasoning is the task of continuously deriving conclusions on streaming data. Different research communities emphasize different aspects such as throughput vs. expressiveness, yet a mathematical model to describe the declarative semantics of such systems has been missing. This motivated the logic-based framework LARS for analytic reasoning over streams. However, it is also attractive for applications by itself.",
